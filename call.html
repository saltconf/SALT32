              We invite submission of abstracts for 30-minute oral presentations
              (with an additional 10 minutes for questions) or posters (with a short lightning round presentation prior to the poster session) on any
              topic in natural language semantics with relevance to linguistic
              theory. 
            </p>

              <b><span class="alert">Deadline:</span> <strike>Monday, November 15, 2021</strike> Wednesday, December 1, 2021</b>             <!-- modify -->
            </p>
            <p>
              Submissions should be made via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=salt32">SALT32 EasyChair site</a>. We expect to notify authors of their acceptance in early February of 2022.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>
              Abstracts (and their metadata) must be completely anonymous. The main text should be at most 2 pages (US Letter or A4) in length, including examples, with an optional third page ONLY for references, large graphs, tables, pictures, figures, and non-English, glossed examples. The abstract should use a 12pt font and 1 inch margins (for US Letter) or 3 cm margins (for A4) on all four sides. The abstract must be submitted as a single PDF file. These limitations will be strictly enforced. In addition to the intellectual interest of the abstract, clarity and readability will also be taken into account in reviewing. The name of the studied language(s) should be included as keywords in the abstract (even if it is English).</p>
            <p>
              SALT32 will feature a poster session. Poster presentations will             <!-- modify -->
              be published as regular papers in the proceedings. 
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Policies</h2>
            <p>
              Authors may be involved in at most two abstracts and may be the sole 
              author of at most one abstract.
            </p>
            <p>
              SALT does not accept papers that, at the time of the conference, have been
              published or have been accepted for publication. In addition,
              preference will be given to presentations that are not duplicated
              at other major conferences. 
            </p> 
            <p>
              If the work or a close variant of it is under submission to or accepted 
              for publication or presentation in any other major venue (such as a national 
              or international conference or a journal/book chapter), we request that the 
              authors create a small section titled "Additional Submission" after the 
              references at the end of the paper. This section should include the other 
              venue(s) for which the work has been submitted, the status of those submissions, 
              and an indication of any major aspects of the SALT abstract not submitted 
              elsewhere. We require that authors update us by email if/when there is a 
              relevant change in the status of other submissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              SALT has a <a href="conduct.html">code of conduct</a> and by submitting an 
              abstract and by attending the conference, you are agreeing to abide by the code.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Proceedings</h2>
            <p>
              All papers presented at the conference (including oral presentations, posters, 
              and alternates, and including presentations at the workshop) will be published 
              in a SALT 32 volume following the conclusion of the conference.
